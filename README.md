# GoTour

Repository containing solutions for exercises from the **Golang Tour**.

To run a solution locally simply position the terminal into the appropriate folder for the exercise and run:\
`go run main.go`

*Note: some exercise solutions with image results (exercises **02_slices** and **09_images**) won't be displayed optimally within a terminal, so the code should be pasted within the Web Golang Tour and run from there using the **SHIFT + ENTER** shortcut.*
